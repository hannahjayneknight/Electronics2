##  Exercise 1: Moving Average filter

*Files:* lab6task1a.m, lab6task1b.m <br />

**What:** The MATLAB file _lab6task1a.m_ adds noise to a music sample, then uses a moving average filter to attempt to remove that noise. <br />

When playing back the music sample for which the moving average filter had been applied, noise clearly still existed in the file, however, the amount of noise had been reduced. 

**Change the variable for the number of taps:**
