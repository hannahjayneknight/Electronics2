# Electronics2

All my work associated with the Electronics 2 module, year 2, Design Engineering at Imperial College London.

Note: As suggested by my previous tutor in Electronics 1, I aim to make concepts and topics easier to find within this repo for my assessed oral.


## Lab Objectives

1. Lab1 - Introduction to MATLAB
    1. Function that generates a sine signal.
    2. Function that plots a frequency spectrum.
    3. Comining two sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes and plotting the resulting waveforma and frequency spectrum.
    4. As above (exercise 3) but with noise added.
    5. Projecting signals onto one another using the dot product.

2. Lab2
