## Exercise 1: Check that Matlab on your computer is talking to PyBench hardware

**Issues:** Took some time to recognise PyBench. Try restarting MATLAB a few times if it happens again.<br />


## Exercise 2: Using PyBench to generate signals via Matlab and explore their spectra

**Files:** lab2task2.m <br />

**What:**  <br />

1. Checking that a 440Hz sinewave, triangular wave and square wave are generated by the PyBench board on the analogue output pin a_out.<br />

2. 

**Notes:** Task 1 seemed to take a very long time to get up and running. Errors kept appearing on MATLAB. Suddenly, (after 4.5 hours of trying), it worked after seemingly changing nothing! <br /> Once all the equipment was working, the results could be looked at in more detail. Changing the frequency and voltage of the wave had the obvious result of changing the period and amplitude of the waveform (the results can be seen in image ex2_square2.jpg where the max_v was set to 1.0 V and signal frequency set to 200 Hz). <br />

## Exercise 3: Capture and analyse microphone signals

**Files for task3:** lab2task3.m <br />

**Changing the sampling frequency:** tunning fork aliased.png <br />

**Changing the number of samples results:**  500a.png, 500b.png, 1000a.png, 1000b.png, 2000a.png, 2000b.png (NB: files with an _a_ are the frequency spectrums and files with a _b_ are the sample number vs voltage plots) <br />

**Files for task3a:** lab2task3a.m, 3000Hz.mov, 3500Hz.mov, 4000Hz.mov, 4500Hz.mov, 5000Hz.mov<br />

**What:** task3 was run and a teammate whistled into her microphone which recorded a snapshot of her voice. On the other hand, task3a continously collects data and plots in the spectrum using a while loop. <br />

**Notes:** A very nice frequency and time plot were produced by MATLAB. <br />

We changed the sampling frequency to 500 Hz (which is less than 2 times the frequency of the tuning fork wave) to see the effect of aliasing. The resulting frequency spectrum had a peak at 50 Hz instead of the correct frequency of 440 Hz which is due to the fact that the high frequencies have folded back into the spectrum of the discrete time series and appeared as a lower frequency. The result can be seen in the following images: tunning fork aliased.png <br />

Increasing the number of samples (N) collected by the microphone improved the precision of the frequency spectrum peak. On the spectrum, this looks like a sharper peak with no curves either side. This effect is due to the fact that increasing the number of samples means that the mean value of the signal is more accurate. The mean value represents the DC offset which we want to remove.  DC offset occurs in the capturing of sound, before it reaches the recorder, and is normally caused by defective or low-quality equipment (more information can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_bias). In conclusion, by increasing the number of samples, we increase the accuracy of the mean of the signal, which increases the accuracy of the DC offset which is removed, so what is left is a more accurate frequency peak. <br />

## Exercise 4: Windowing effect on a signal

**Files task4:** lab2task4.m, /Lab 2 files/plot_spec_dB.m, <br />

**Files task4a:** lab2task4a.m, 4a-440Hz.mov <br />

**What:**  The same measurements were made as task3, except the results were plotted on a logarithmic frequency spectrum where the amplitude was measured in dB (using plot_spec_dB.m rather than plot_spec). <br /> 

Similar to task3, the code was modified by introducing a while loop. Here we apply a window (known as Hamming Window) to the signal before calculating the spectrum. <br />

**The hamming window:**  The graph _task4a hamming window spectrum.png_ shows the signal with the hamming window in red. Introducing the Hamming Window meant that the small amount of noise that existed before was removed, however, a lot of noise still remained. This could be due to the poor quality of the microphone. The improvement in accuracy can also be seen by the sharpness of the peaks increasing when a hamming window is implemented.<br />

**Notes:**  Using a log scale provides much higher sensitivity than a linear scale. The plot is also normalized in a way that the maximum frequency component is at 0dB, i.e. all spectral components are relatively scaled to the peak spectral value. Finally, the magnitude axis is limited to 0dB to -60dB.<br />

NB: The signal processing tool box for Matlab was needed to be downloaded for this exercise. <br />

## Exercise 5: Music signal segmentation and analysis

**Files:**  lab2task5.m, drum.fig, drum_energy.fig<br />

**What:**  Firstly, MATLAB plotted the signal for the music file (which consists of sequence of single drum beats). The _buffer()_ method was used (from the signal processing toolbox) to split the sound file into 20 ms intervals. (It does this by splitting into how many samples you want, the sample is 6 seconds long so we wanted 6/ 0.02 samples.) <br /> 

Next, the energy of each 20 ms second interval was calculated and plotted forming the drum_energy.fig. This was calculated using the formula shown.

The peaks of the energy wave were highlighted.<br />

**Notes:**  <br />
