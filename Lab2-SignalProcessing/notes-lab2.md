## Exercise 1: Check that Matlab on your computer is talking to PyBench hardware

**Issues:** Took some time to recognise PyBench. Try restarting MATLAB a few times if it happens again.<br />


## Exercise 2: Using PyBench to generate signals via Matlab and explore their spectra

**Files:** lab2task2.m, ex2_sine.jpeg, ex2_triangle.jpeg, ex2_square.jpeg <br />

**What:**  <br />

1. Checking that a 440Hz sinewave, triangular wave and square wave are generated by the PyBench board on the analogue output pin a_out.<br />

2. 

**Notes:** Task 1 seemed to take a very long time. Errors kept coming back on MATLAB. <br />

## Exercise 3: Capture and analyse microphone signals
