## Exercise 1: Sinusoidal signal generation

Files: sine_gen.m, sine_gen_test.fig, sine_gen_test.png <br />

Made a function that generates a sine wave. <br />

Inputs: amplitude amp, frequency f, sampling frequency fs and duration T. Finds the sampling time period to make an array from 0 to T with a gap of sampling time period. <br />

To test the function, a 400Hz sine wave was drawn with an amplitude of 1.

## Exercise 2: Spectrum of the signal
